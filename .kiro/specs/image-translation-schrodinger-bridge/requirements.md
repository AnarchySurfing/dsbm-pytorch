## Introduction

This feature implements a Schrödinger Bridge-based image translation system specifically for visible light RGB to infrared RGB image translation. The system will enable high-quality translation from visible spectrum images to infrared spectrum images using paired datasets, leveraging the theoretical framework of optimal transport and Schrödinger bridges. The implementation emphasizes modularity by separating dataset loading from core functionality, allowing easy integration of different visible-to-infrared paired image datasets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to train a Schrödinger bridge model on paired visible-to-infrared RGB image datasets, so that I can perform high-quality visible-to-infrared image translation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a paired visible-infrared RGB dataset THEN the system SHALL load visible light images as source and infrared images as target
2. WHEN training is initiated THEN the system SHALL use the DSBM (Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching) algorithm to learn the optimal transport from visible to infrared domain
3. WHEN the model is trained THEN it SHALL generate infrared-style images that preserve the semantic structure and content of the visible input
4. IF the dataset contains images of different sizes THEN the system SHALL resize them to a consistent resolution while maintaining aspect ratios
5. WHEN processing both visible and infrared RGB images THEN the system SHALL normalize pixel values to the range [-1, 1] and handle potential domain-specific preprocessing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular dataset interface, so that I can easily integrate different visible-to-infrared paired datasets without modifying core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new visible-infrared dataset THEN the developer SHALL only need to create a new dataset class following the standard paired interface
2. WHEN a dataset class is created THEN it SHALL inherit from a common base class that defines the visible-infrared paired data interface
3. WHEN loading paired data THEN the system SHALL return visible RGB images as source tensors and infrared RGB images as target tensors
4. IF dataset metadata is available THEN the system SHALL provide access to image paths, capture conditions (time, weather), and spectral information
5. WHEN switching between different visible-infrared datasets THEN the system SHALL require only configuration changes, not code modifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want configurable training parameters, so that I can optimize the model for visible-to-infrared translation tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring training THEN the user SHALL be able to specify image resolution, batch size, and number of training iterations optimized for cross-spectral translation

2. WHEN generating samples THEN the system SHALL create side-by-side comparisons of visible source, infrared target, and generated infrared images
3. WHEN training progresses THEN the system SHALL periodically save generated infrared samples for visual inspection and spectral analysis
4. IF ground truth infrared images are available THEN the system SHALL compute pixel-level, perceptual, and spectral similarity metrics
5. WHEN evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with quantitative results, visual samples, and spectral analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a practitioner, I want efficient data handling for large visible-infrared image datasets, so that I can train on high-resolution spectral images without memory constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large visible-infrared datasets THEN the system SHALL implement memory-efficient data loading with caching mechanisms for paired spectral data
2. WHEN processing high-resolution spectral images THEN the system SHALL support multi-scale training and progressive resolution increase for both visible and infrared domains
3. WHEN memory is limited THEN the system SHALL implement data streaming and on-demand loading for paired spectral images
4. IF the spectral dataset is too large for memory THEN the system SHALL use memory-mapped files for efficient access to paired image data
5. WHEN training on multiple GPUs THEN the system SHALL distribute paired spectral data loading across workers efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible inference capabilities, so that I can translate new visible light images to infrared using trained models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trained visible-to-infrared model is available THEN the user SHALL be able to load it for inference on new visible light images
2. WHEN performing inference THEN the system SHALL support both single visible image and batch processing for infrared generation
3. WHEN generating infrared translations THEN the user SHALL be able to control the number of sampling steps for quality-speed trade-offs in spectral conversion
4. IF multiple model checkpoints exist THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific model versions trained on different spectral datasets
5. WHEN inference is complete THEN the system SHALL save infrared results in standard image formats with optional spectral metadata

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with existing DSBM infrastructure, so that I can leverage the proven algorithms and training procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing image translation THEN the system SHALL reuse existing DSBM trainer classes and algorithms
2. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing Hydra configuration system
3. WHEN training starts THEN the system SHALL support existing features like EMA, gradient clipping, and distributed training
4. IF caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL use the existing DBDSB_CacheLoader for efficient data management
5. WHEN logging is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing logging infrastructure (Weights & Biases, CSV)
